The spine issues were noted frequently at a rate of 0.35, while knee issues were less frequent at 0.15. To enhance your posture, focus on strengthening your core and practicing spinal alignment exercises, which can help address those spine concerns. Additionally, incorporating stretching and strengthening for your knees will provide better support.
